MD walker

!!! INPUT
 imin = 0       ! no minimization
 irest = 0      ! new simulation
 ntx = 1        ! read in coordinates only

!! irest = 1      ! restarting a simulation
!! ntx = 5    	! read in coordinates and velocities

!!! OUTPUT
 ntxo = 2       ! restart file format binary
 ntpr = 10000    ! write energy information every .... steps to log file
 ntwx = 10000    ! write coordinates every .... steps to a trajectory file
 ntwe = 10000    ! write energies/temperature every .... steps to corresponding file
 ntwr = 10000    ! write information every .... steps to restart file
 ioutfm = 1     ! use binary NetCDF format for trajectories
 iwrap = 0	! DO NOT wrap coordinates into unit cell

!!! DYNAMICS
 nstlim = 10000 ! perform ... MD steps
 dt = 0.002       ! time step in ps

!!! TEMPERATURE
 ntt = 3        ! constant temperature
 temp0 = 300    ! T = ... K
 gamma_ln = 2   ! collision frequency [units of 1/ps]
 ig = RAND      ! take pseudo-random-number seed from WESTPA 

!!! PRESSURE
 ntp = 1        ! constant pressure, isotropic scaling
 barostat = 2   ! Monte Carlo barostat
 pres0 = 1.0	! reference pressure = 1 bar
 taup = 3.0     ! pressure relaxation time = 3 ps 

!!! CONSTRAINTS OR RESTRAINTS 
 ntc = 2        ! bonds with hydrogens constrained
 ntr = 0 	! no positional restraints

!!! POTENTIAL ENERGY EVALUATION
 ntf = 2        ! ignore bonded interactions with hydrogens (ntc != 1)
 ntb = 2	! constant-pressure PBCs
 cut = 8.0	! non-bonded cutoff in A (should be 10-ish for good accuracy)
 nsnb = 25      ! update nonbonded list every ... steps (should be set to 20 for good accuracy)

!!! MISCELLANEOUS
 nmropt = 1     ! allowing for varying conditions to be defined below (e.g. T cycles, restraints, ...)
